## ecosia-password-gen
**Plant trees... securely :D**

### About
This is an implementation of my [Ecosia extension tool](https://github.com/nbennett320/ecosia-widget-react) -- it adds a password generation feature to Ecosia, obviously inspired by [DuckDuckGo's password generation feature](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+strong+12&ia=answer) _[(more info)](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/instant-answers-and-other-features/)_.
The idea is that cool new features like this one will help reel in new users to Ecosia, and new Ecosia users === more trees planted ðŸŒ³ðŸ’ž.
